What kind of change does this PR introduce?

Feature - Extract reusable UserTableRow component for admin screens

Issue Number:

Fixes #5085

Snapshots/Videos:

N/A - Component refactoring with no visual changes

If relevant, did you update the documentation?

Yes - Added comprehensive TSDoc documentation with @example blocks to UserTableRow component

Summary

This PR extracts a reusable UserTableRow component to consolidate repeated user row UI (avatar, name/link, email, dates, actions) used across multiple admin screens. The component eliminates code duplication and provides consistent user table rendering across OrganizationPeople, BlockUser, and Users screens.

Key Changes:

Created UserTableRow component in src/components/AdminPortal/UserTableRow/
Added TypeScript interfaces in src/types/AdminPortal/UserTableRow/interface.ts
Migrated OrganizationPeople, BlockUser, and Users screens to use UserTableRow
Added comprehensive TSDoc documentation with usage examples
Fixed header alignment and joined date display bugs in BlockUser screen
Removed unused imports and cleaned up code
Does this PR introduce a breaking change?

No - All existing functionality preserved with improved consistency

CodeRabbit blocks several paths by default. You can override this behavior by explicitly including those paths in the path filters. For example, including **/dist/** will override the default block on the dist directory, by removing the pattern from both the lists.

Walkthrough
Adds a reusable UserTableRow React component (with types, CSS, and tests), migrates admin screens to use it, updates locale keys across languages, adjusts related tests and mocks, and removes a MockedProvider flag.

Changes
Cohort / File(s)	Summary
UserTableRow component
src/components/AdminPortal/UserTableRow/UserTableRow.tsx, src/components/AdminPortal/UserTableRow/UserTableRow.spec.tsx, src/components/AdminPortal/UserTableRow/UserTableRow.module.css	New component (named + default export) and tests; CSS adds gridCell, gridCellPointer, tableRowPointer; supports data-grid/table modes, compact mode, link navigation, rowNumber, joined date, configurable actions, onRowClick with action click suppression, and testId generation.
Type definitions
src/types/AdminPortal/UserTableRow/interface.ts	New exported types: InterfaceUserInfo, InterfaceActionVariant, InterfaceActionButton, InterfaceUserTableRowProps.
Screens — migrations
src/screens/AdminPortal/Users/Users.tsx, src/screens/AdminPortal/OrganizationPeople/OrganizationPeople.tsx, src/screens/BlockUser/BlockUser.tsx	Replaced per-row renderers with UserTableRow; updated headers, action arrays, navigation (useNavigate), ID coercions to string, removed direct Button/Link usage and localStorage access, and wired testIdPrefix/action testIds.
Tests updated / added
src/screens/AdminPortal/OrganizationPeople/OrganizationPeople.spec.tsx, src/screens/BlockUser/BlockUser.spec.tsx, src/screens/AdminPortal/Users/Users.spec.tsx	Adjusted assertions for new "user"/"Joined" column and date format; updated tab selection queries; added null-name handling test; aligned tests to new component behavior.
Localization
public/locales/... (multiple files)	Added no_email, no_name, na, user_row to common.json and added joined and actions keys in translation.json across en/es/fr/hi/zh locales.
Mocks / tests utility
src/components/Advertisements/AdvertisementsMocks.ts, src/screens/AdminPortal/PluginStore/UploadPluginModal.spec.tsx	Removed addTypename={false} from MockedProvider in mocks; tests updated to use a shared InMemoryCache in some MockedProvider usages.

🧹 Nitpick | 🔵 Trivial

Simplify verbose type assertion.

The inline type assertion can be replaced with a simpler approach by ensuring mapVariantToColor returns the MUI ButtonProps color type directly.

🧹 Nitpick | 🔵 Trivial

Shared InMemoryCache across tests may leak Apollo state

Using a single module‑scope const cache = new InMemoryCache() and passing it into nearly every <MockedProvider cache={cache}> means all tests share one Apollo cache instance. If UploadPluginModal (now or in future changes) performs real GraphQL operations, writes from one test can affect subsequent tests via cached data.

A more isolated pattern is to create a fresh cache per render/helper, e.g. cache={new InMemoryCache()} or a small renderWithProvider helper that instantiates a new cache each time. Not strictly a blocker today (most behavior is mocked via adminPluginInstaller), but worth adjusting to avoid subtle cross‑test coupling.

Also applies to: 43-44, 78-81

⚠️ Potential issue | 🟠 Major

Out-of-scope change: Remove from this PR.

This file tests the SubTags screen, which is not mentioned in the PR objectives (UserTableRow extraction for OrganizationPeople, BlockUser, and Users screens). While removing addTypename={false} is technically correct per Apollo Client deprecation guidelines, it represents unrelated test infrastructure cleanup that should be handled in a separate PR.

Rationale:

Mixing feature work (UserTableRow extraction) with unrelated test maintenance increases review complexity and risk
The PR should focus solely on UserTableRow component and its adoption in the three target screens
Test infrastructure cleanup (addTypename removal across 115+ files) warrants its own dedicated PR for proper tracking and rollback capability
Recommendation:
Revert this change and include it in a focused PR specifically for Apollo MockedProvider deprecation cleanup across all affected test files.

🧹 Nitpick | 🔵 Trivial

Consider consolidating duplicate cursor pointer styles.

The .gridCellPointer and .tableRowPointer classes both define identical cursor: pointer styles. While functionally correct, consolidating them into a single reusable class would reduce duplication.

Consider consolidating the two “no onRowClick” tests

handles row click when onRowClick is not provided and handles early return in handleRowClick when onRowClick is not provided exercise the same code path; keeping only one of them would reduce noise without losing coverage.

🧹 Nitpick | 🔵 Trivial

Screen test is tightly coupled to UserTableRow’s joined-date rendering

Asserting the exact string Joined: 2023-01-01 binds this screen test to the shared UserTableRow’s internal text/formatting, which is already validated in the component’s own spec. Per the shared testing guidelines, consider only asserting that the member rows render correctly (names/emails, presence of rows) and rely on UserTableRow.spec.tsx for the detailed “Joined” label/format checks.

🧹 Nitpick | 🔵 Trivial

Consider aligning header and cell alignment for visual consistency.

The column has align: 'left' for cell content but headerAlign: 'center'. This may cause the header text to appear misaligned with the row content. If intentional, this is fine; otherwise, consider aligning both.

🧹 Nitpick | 🔵 Trivial

Use the user parameter in action onClick for interface consistency.

The UserTableRow component passes the user object to action.onClick(user). The current implementation uses a closure capturing params.row.id, which works but doesn't follow the interface contract. Using the passed parameter improves consistency and makes the code more resilient to refactoring.
