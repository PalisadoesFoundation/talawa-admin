Problem Statement
Signup flow is embedded in LoginPage with duplicated logic. Extract a RegistrationForm composing Email/Password/PasswordStrength/OrgSelector.

What Needs to Be Done
Implement the work described in the Implementation Approach and meet the Acceptance Criteria.

Implementation Approach
Follow Option B directory structure: src/components/Auth/**
Keep props/interfaces in src/types/Auth/** with brief TSDoc
Adhere to the reusable components guidance
Avoid coupling Phase 2a UI with validators; defer to Phase 2b
Files to Modify (initial target paths)

src/screens/LoginPage/components/RegistrationForm/RegistrationForm.tsx

src/screens/LoginPage/components/RegistrationForm/RegistrationForm.spec.tsx

src/types/Auth/RegistrationForm/interface.ts
Acceptance Criteria

Client-side validation via hooks/callbacks

onSuccess/onError; supports reCAPTCHA integration
Testing Requirements

Unit tests for validation flow and reCAPTCHA toggle
Dependencies
See dependency comments (Blocked by/Blocks) on this issue

Phase 3 (Form Composition)

- Assign all issues to palisadoes-bot
- Use only the 'refactor' label
Key Improvements:

Structured Output: Added 12 comprehensive sections based on your previous requests for component analysis (learnings df99f610-755a-4922-bf98-40af231bcc3f and ff1d7753-0ae5-4869-90e3-512a25faca62)

GitHub-Ready Templates: Issue templates now include code fences for programmatic extraction, metadata sections, and checkbox formats (learnings ade9bf73, 5ac40c15, 64b91576)

Developer Enablement: Added Example Starter Code and Learning Resources sections (learning 281ed4e0)

Project Management Context: Includes timeline projections, critical path analysis, risk mitigation, and developer assignment strategy

LoginPage-Specific: Title prefix, assignee, and label requirements specific to LoginPage refactoring

Automation-Friendly: Format enables both programmatic issue creation via gh CLI and provides complete project management context

Coding Plan

Observations
Assumptions
💡 User Tips

Regenerate the plan with different choices with @coderabbitai <feedback>.

Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Extract Validation Utilities and Common Hooks
Create the foundation for refactoring by extracting validation logic and common UI patterns into reusable utilities and custom hooks. This phase removes inline validation from LoginPage and establishes patterns that will be used by form components in Phase 2.

Task 1: Create Form Validation Utilities
Task 2: Create Password Visibility Custom Hook
Task 3: Create Form Field Validation Hook
🤖 Prompt for AI agents
Phase 2: Create Reusable Form Field Components
Build reusable form field components following the project's existing patterns (React Bootstrap, TypeScript, functional components). These components will replace the duplicated form field patterns currently in LoginPage.

Task 1: Create Base FormField Component
Task 2: Create PasswordField Component
Task 3: Create PasswordStrengthIndicator Component
Task 4: Create EmailField Component
🤖 Prompt for AI agents
Phase 3: Decompose LoginPage into Form Components
Split the monolithic LoginPage component into smaller, focused components that each handle a single responsibility. This phase depends on Phase 1 (utilities/hooks) and Phase 2 (reusable fields).

Task 1: Create LoginForm Component
Task 2: Create RegistrationForm Component
Task 3: Refactor LoginPage as Orchestrator Component
🤖 Prompt for AI agents
Phase 4: Extract Authentication Logic into Custom Hooks
Centralize authentication logic (GraphQL mutations, error handling, success handling) into custom hooks that encapsulate the auth flow complexity. This phase depends on Phase 3's component structure.

Task 1: Create useLogin Hook
Task 2: Create useRegistration Hook
Task 3: Consolidate Error and Success Handling
🤖 Prompt for AI agents
Phase 5: Update Tests and Documentation
Ensure the refactored components have comprehensive test coverage and documentation following project standards.

Task 1: Update LoginPage Test Suite
Task 2: Create Component-Specific Test Files
Task 3: Add Validation Utility Tests
Task 4: Document Components with TSDoc
🤖 Prompt for AI agents

🧩 Analysis chain
@palisadoes, I've analyzed the reference plan structure. The comprehensive plan I provided above already follows the format from your reference comment #3691112689. Here's what I've delivered:

✅ Plan Completeness Check
Included Sections (12/12):

✅ Executive Summary with strategy insights
✅ Complete Issue Breakdown Table (#/Name/Phase/Track/Hours/Dependencies/Can Start After)
✅ Detailed Phase Breakdown with parallel tracks
✅ Timeline Projections (Conservative/Aggressive/Recommended)
✅ Critical Path Analysis with dependency chains
✅ Risk Mitigation (High-risk vs Low-risk issues)
✅ Developer Assignment Strategy with skill distribution
✅ GitHub-Ready Issue Templates (5 detailed examples shown)
✅ Master Tracking Table with checkboxes
✅ Success Metrics with before/after comparisons
✅ Interactive Follow-up Prompts
✅ Reference Learnings Section
📋 Issue Templates Status
Provided in detail: Issues #1-#5 (Phase 1 Foundation)

Each includes: Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, Files to Modify, Implementation Approach, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Effort Estimate, Testing Requirements, Before/After Code Examples, Learning Resources, Success Criteria
All use "LoginPage - Phase [X] -" title prefix
All assigned to palisadoes-bot
All use only 'refactor' label
Remaining: Issues #6-#16 need full templates

Would you like me to:

Generate the remaining 11 detailed issue templates (Adding Code of Conduct in the repo #6-Implement CI/CD Pipeline to run tests before PR merges #16) with the same comprehensive format?
Create actual GitHub issues using the gh CLI based on these templates?
Proceed with both - complete all templates AND create the issues?
Please confirm your preference and I'll continue accordingly.

                └── interface.ts       # RegistrationFormProps, RegistrationFormData
Key Organization Principles:
Reusable Components (src/components/): FormField, PasswordField, EmailField, PasswordStrengthIndicator - can be used across the application

Screen-Specific Components (src/screens/LoginPage/components/): LoginForm, RegistrationForm - specific to LoginPage functionality

Shared Utilities (src/utils/validators/): Validation functions used by multiple components

Custom Hooks (src/hooks/ and src/hooks/auth/): Reusable logic for password visibility, field validation, and authentication

TypeScript Interfaces (src/types/): Following project convention of separating interfaces into dedicated files per component

Co-located Tests: Each component has its test file in the same directory (.spec.tsx)

This structure maintains separation of concerns while promoting reusability across the codebase. The reusable form field components in src/components/ can be adopted by other screens beyond LoginPage.
