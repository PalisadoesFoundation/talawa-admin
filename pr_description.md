N/A (Frontend Implementation Only)

**Summary**

This PR implements the frontend UI and logic for the **Email Registration Verification** flow. It ensures that users are informed about their verification status and can verify their email address seamlessly.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **New `VerifyEmail` Screen**: Created `src/screens/Auth/VerifyEmail/VerifyEmail.tsx` to handle the verification process using the token from the URL. It supports loading, success, and error states.
2.  **Route Configuration**: Added `/verify-email` (and `/auth/verify-email`) routes in `App.tsx` to support verification links generated by the backend.
3.  **Login & Signup Flow Improvements**:
    -   **Login Page**: Added logic to detect unverified users and display a persistent warning banner if they log in without verifying.
    -   **Signup**: Updated logic to auto-redirect to the dashboard upon successful signup and immediately show the verification banner.
    -   **Redirection Fix**: Fixed an issue where authenticated users were stuck in a loop or saw "Action Forbidden" errors by properly redirecting them based on their `role`.
4.  **Dashboard Integration**: Updated `Organizations.tsx` (User) and `OrgList.tsx` (Admin) to:
    -   Display a dismissible warning banner with a "Resend Verification Email" button.
    -   Actively sync with the backend (`CURRENT_USER` query) to automatically remove the banner once verified (e.g., if verified in another tab).
5.  **Robust Error Handling**: Added specific handling for "Unauthenticated" errors during verification to guide users to log in instead of showing a generic failure.
6.  **GraphQL & i18n**: Added necessary mutations (`VERIFY_EMAIL`, `RESEND_VERIFICATION_EMAIL`) and translation keys for English.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

No

**Other information**

-   **Backend Sync**: The dashboard now intelligently prioritizes API data over `localStorage` flags, ensuring the verification status is always accurate even if the user verifies the email on a different device or browser.
-   **Security**: Verification links now strictly enforce authentication as required by the backend, with clear UI feedback if the session is missing.
