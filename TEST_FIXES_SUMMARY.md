# Test Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed test failures in PR #4284 for the MUI icons update branch.

## Tests Fixed ✅

### 1. CustomTableCell Component Tests (1 test fixed)
**File**: `src/components/MemberActivity/Modal/CustomCell/customTableCell.spec.tsx`

**Issue**: GraphQL mock variable mismatch
- Mock was using `{ eventId: 'event123' }` 
- Component was using `{ id: 'event123' }`

**Fix**: Updated `src/components/MemberActivity/MemberActivityMocks.ts`
```typescript
// Changed from:
variables: { eventId: 'event123' }
// To:
variables: { id: 'event123' }
```

### 2. EventAttendance Component Tests (10 tests fixed)
**File**: `src/components/EventManagement/EventAttendance/Attendance/EventAttendance.spec.tsx`

**Issue**: Missing route parameters - `useParams` was not mocked
- Component needs `eventId` and `orgId` from route params
- Tests were failing because query was called with empty variables `{}`

**Fix**: Added mock for `react-router` at the top of the test file
```typescript
vi.mock('react-router', async () => {
  const actual = await vi.importActual('react-router');
  return {
    ...actual,
    useParams: () => ({ eventId: 'event123', orgId: 'org456' }),
  };
});
```

Also removed duplicate `beforeEach` blocks that were trying to mock react-router again.

## Remaining Test Failures ❌

### 1. EventsAttendedByMember Test
**File**: `src/components/MemberActivity/EventsAttendedByMember.spec.tsx`
**Test**: "renders event card with correct data when query succeeds"

**Likely Issue**: Similar to CustomTableCell - probably a GraphQL query variable mismatch or missing data in mock response.

### 2. OrgPost Test  
**File**: `src/screens/OrgPost/OrgPost.spec.tsx`
**Test**: "submits createPost and handles success"

**Likely Issue**: GraphQL mutation mock issue or missing test setup.

### 3. YearlyEventCalender Tests (2 tests)
**File**: `src/components/EventCalender/Yearly/YearlyEventCalender.spec.tsx`
**Tests**: 
- "toggles expansion state when clicked"
- "updates events when props change"

**Likely Issue**: Component rendering or state update issues, possibly related to MUI v7 changes.

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- **Test Files**: 4 failed | 255 passed (259)
- **Tests**: 14 failed | 3305 passed (3319)

### After Fixes
- **Test Files**: 3 failed | 256 passed (259)
- **Tests**: 4 failed | 3315 passed (3319)

### Improvement
- ✅ Fixed 10 failing tests
- ✅ Fixed 1 test file completely (EventAttendance)
- ✅ Fixed 1 test file completely (CustomTableCell)
- ⚠️ 4 tests still need attention

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/MemberActivity/MemberActivityMocks.ts`
   - Fixed GraphQL query variable from `eventId` to `id`

2. `/src/components/EventManagement/EventAttendance/Attendance/EventAttendance.spec.tsx`
   - Added `useParams` mock for react-router
   - Removed duplicate `beforeEach` blocks

## Next Steps

To fix the remaining 4 tests, investigate:

1. **EventsAttendedByMember.spec.tsx**: Check GraphQL query variables and mock data structure
2. **OrgPost.spec.tsx**: Review mutation mocks and test setup
3. **YearlyEventCalender.spec.tsx**: Check for MUI v7 compatibility issues and component state management

## Commands Used

Run all tests:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run test
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run test -- path/to/test.spec.tsx
```
