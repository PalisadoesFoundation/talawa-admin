# Function: default()

> **default**(): `JSX.Element`

Defined in: [src/screens/UserPortal/Donate/Donate.tsx:84](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/blob/main/src/screens/UserPortal/Donate/Donate.tsx#L84)

`donate` component allows users to make donations to an organization and view their previous donations.

This component fetches donation-related data using GraphQL queries and allows users to make donations
using a mutation. It supports currency selection, donation amount input, and displays a paginated list
of previous donations.

It includes:
- An input field for searching donations.
- A dropdown to select currency.
- An input field for entering donation amount.
- A button to submit the donation.
- A list of previous donations displayed in a paginated format.
- An organization sidebar for navigation.

### GraphQL Queries
- `ORGANIZATION_DONATION_CONNECTION_LIST`: Fetches the list of donations for the organization.
- `USER_ORGANIZATION_CONNECTION`: Fetches organization details.

### GraphQL Mutations
- `DONATE_TO_ORGANIZATION`: Performs the donation action.

## Returns

`JSX.Element`

The rendered component.

## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.inputField`
- `.searchButton`
- `.addButton`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
