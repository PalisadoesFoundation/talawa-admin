# Function: default()

> **default**(): `JSX.Element`

Defined in: [src/screens/UserPortal/Posts/Posts.tsx:130](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/blob/main/src/screens/UserPortal/Posts/Posts.tsx#L130)

`home` component displays the main feed for a user, including posts, promoted content, and options to create a new post.

It utilizes Apollo Client for fetching and managing data through GraphQL queries. The component fetches and displays posts from an organization, promoted advertisements, and handles user interactions for creating new posts. It also manages state for displaying modal dialogs and handling file uploads for new posts.

## Returns

`JSX.Element`

JSX.Element - The rendered `home` component.

## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.inputField`
- `.addButton`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
