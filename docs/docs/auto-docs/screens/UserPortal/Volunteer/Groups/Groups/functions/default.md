# Function: default()

> **default**(): `JSX.Element`

Defined in: [src/screens/UserPortal/Volunteer/Groups/Groups.tsx:73](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/blob/main/src/screens/UserPortal/Volunteer/Groups/Groups.tsx#L73)

Component for managing volunteer groups for an event.
This component allows users to view, filter, sort, and create action items. It also provides a modal for creating and editing action items.

## Returns

`JSX.Element`

The rendered component.

## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.searchButton`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
