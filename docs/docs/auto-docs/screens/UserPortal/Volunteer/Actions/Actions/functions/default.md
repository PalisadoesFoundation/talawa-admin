# Function: default()

> **default**(): `JSX.Element`

Defined in: [src/screens/UserPortal/Volunteer/Actions/Actions.tsx:80](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/blob/main/src/screens/UserPortal/Volunteer/Actions/Actions.tsx#L80)

Component for managing and displaying action items within an organization.

This component allows users to view, filter, sort, and create action items. It also handles fetching and displaying related data such as action item categories and members.

## Returns

`JSX.Element`

The rendered component.

## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.editButton`
- `.switch`
- `.searchButton`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
