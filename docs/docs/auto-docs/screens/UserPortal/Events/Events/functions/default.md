# Function: default()

> **default**(): `JSX.Element`

Defined in: [src/screens/UserPortal/Events/Events.tsx:62](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/blob/main/src/screens/UserPortal/Events/Events.tsx#L62)

Component to manage and display events for an organization.

This component allows users to view, create, and manage events within an organization.
It includes a calendar view, a form to create new events, and various filters and settings.

## Returns

`JSX.Element`

The JSX element for the events management interface.

## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.inputField`
- `.switch`
- `.addButton`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
