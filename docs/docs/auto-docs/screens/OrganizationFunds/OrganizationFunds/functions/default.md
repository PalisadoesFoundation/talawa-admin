`organizationFunds` component displays a list of funds for a specific organization,
allowing users to search, sort, view and edit funds.

This component utilizes the `DataGrid` from Material-UI to present the list of funds in a tabular format,
and includes functionality for filtering and sorting. It also handles the opening and closing of modals
for creating and editing.

It includes:
- A search input field to filter funds by name.
- A dropdown menu to sort funds by creation date.
- A button to create a new fund.
- A table to display the list of funds with columns for fund details and actions.
- Modals for creating and editing funds.

- `FUND_LIST`: Fetches a list of funds for the given organization, filtered and sorted based on the provided parameters.

### Props

### State
- `fund`: The currently selected fund for editing or deletion.
- `searchTerm`: The current search term used for filtering funds.
- `sortBy`: The current sorting order for funds.
- `modalState`: The state of the modals (edit/create).
- `fundModalMode`: The mode of the fund modal (edit or create).

### Methods

- `handleClick(fundId: string)`: Navigates to the campaign page for the specified fund.

## Returns

`Element`

The rendered component.

## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.tableHeader`
- `.subtleBlueGrey`
- `.head`
- `.btnsContainer`
- `.input`
- `.inputField`
- `.searchButton`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
