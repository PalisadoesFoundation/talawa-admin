## CSS Strategy Explanation:

To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
(such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- **Reduces redundant CSS code.
- **Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- **Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Global CSS Classes used:
- `.head`
- `.btnsContainer`
- `.input`
- `.inputField`
- `.searchButton`
- `.btnsBlock`

For more details on the reusable classes, refer to the global CSS file.
