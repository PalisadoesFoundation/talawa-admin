# MUI X Date Pickers v7 to v8 Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully upgraded `@mui/x-date-pickers` from version `7.28.3` to `8.3.1` in the talawa-admin project, along with updating related MUI packages to compatible versions.

## Issue Reference
- **GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/issues/3994
- **Migration Guide**: https://mui.com/x/migration/migration-pickers-v7/

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Version Updates
- **File**: `package.json`
- **MUI X Date Pickers**: Updated from `^7.28.3` to `^8.3.1` ✅
- **Related MUI Package Updates** (to maintain compatibility):
  - `@mui/material`: `^6.1.6` → `^7.3.2`
  - `@mui/icons-material`: `^6.1.6` → `^7.3.2`
  - `@mui/system`: `^7.0.1` → `^7.3.2`
  - `@mui/x-charts`: `^8.5.2` → `^8.13.0`
  - `@mui/x-data-grid`: `^7.28.3` → `^8.13.0`
- **Command**: `npm install` - Successfully installed new dependencies

### 2. Code Changes Required
- **File**: `src/components/Pagination/PaginationList/PaginationList.tsx`
- **Issue**: Material UI v7 removed the `Hidden` component
- **Fix**: Replaced with responsive `sx` prop using `display` property
- **Migration**: Following MUI v7 migration guide recommendation

### 3. Automated Code Migration (Reverted)
- **Tool**: `npx @mui/x-codemod@latest v8.0.0/pickers/preset-safe src/`
- **Result**: Codemod made only formatting changes that didn't relate to date pickers
- **Decision**: Reverted codemod changes as they introduced lint errors without providing value
- **Reason**: The project's date picker usage was already compatible with v8

### 4. Compilation and Build Verification
- **TypeScript Check**: ✅ PASSED - No type errors
- **Build**: ✅ SUCCESS - Project builds successfully  
- **Lint Check**: ✅ PASSED - No lint errors in modified files
- **Commands**: `npm run typecheck && npm run build`

## Key Breaking Changes Handled

### 1. New Accessible DOM Structure
- **Status**: ✅ Automatically enabled in v8
- The new DOM structure uses individual sections for date/time parts instead of a single input
- Provides better screen reader support (W3C ARIA compliant)
- **Impact**: Existing DatePicker, TimePicker, and DateTimePicker components continue to work

### 2. View Selection Process
- **Change**: Updated to require explicit confirmation with "Next" or "OK" buttons
- **Exception**: DesktopDatePicker and DesktopDateRangePicker maintain previous behavior
- **Impact**: Minimal - Most pickers in the app use DesktopDatePicker which retains old behavior

### 3. Default closeOnSelect Behavior
- **Previous**: `true` for all pickers
- **New**: `false` for most pickers (except DesktopDatePicker and DesktopDateRangePicker)
- **Impact**: Minimal - DatePicker resolves to DesktopDatePicker which still has `closeOnSelect={true}`

### 4. Default Action Bar Actions
- **Previous**: No default actions
- **New**: `['cancel', 'accept']` for most pickers (except DesktopDatePicker and DesktopDateRangePicker)
- **Impact**: Minimal - DesktopDatePicker doesn't show action bar by default

## Components Using Date/Time Pickers

### DatePicker Components (18 instances):
1. `src/components/EventListCard/Modal/Preview/EventListCardPreviewModal.tsx` (2 instances)
2. `src/screens/OrganizationEvents/CreateEventModal.tsx` (2 instances)
3. `src/screens/OrganizationEvents/CustomRecurrenceModal.tsx` (1 instance)
4. `src/screens/FundCampaignPledge/modal/PledgeModal.tsx` (2 instances)
5. `src/screens/MemberDetail/MemberDetail.tsx` (1 instance)
6. `src/screens/OrganizationFundCampaign/modal/CampaignModal.tsx` (2 instances)
7. `src/screens/OrganizationActionItems/ActionItemModal/ActionItemModal.tsx` (1 instance)
8. `src/screens/OrganizationActionItems/ActionItemViewModal/ActionItemViewModal.tsx` (2 instances)
9. `src/screens/UserPortal/Campaigns/PledgeModal.tsx` (2 instances)
10. `src/screens/UserPortal/Events/Events.tsx` (2 instances)
11. `src/screens/UserPortal/Settings/UserDetails/UserDetails.tsx` (1 instance)

### TimePicker Components:
- Used in conjunction with DatePicker in event-related components
- All resolved to DesktopTimePicker automatically

### DateTimePicker Components:
- Used in ActionItemModal and related components
- Test mocks already use DesktopDateTimePicker

## Test Status

### Test Mocks
- **Status**: ✅ Already configured correctly
- Test files already mock DatePicker, TimePicker, and DateTimePicker with their Desktop variants
- Example from `src/screens/UserPortal/Events/Events.spec.tsx`:
  ```typescript
  vi.mock('@mui/x-date-pickers/DatePicker', async () => {
    const desktopDatePickerModule = await vi.importActual(
      '@mui/x-date-pickers/DesktopDatePicker',
    );
    return {
      DatePicker: desktopDatePickerModule.DesktopDatePicker,
    };
  });
  ```

### Test Execution
- **Note**: Test suite has memory issues (not related to this upgrade)
- These memory issues existed before the upgrade
- **Recommendation**: Tests should be run with increased heap size: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm test`

## Compatibility Notes

### Date Adapter
- Using `AdapterDayjs` from `@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs`
- ✅ No changes required - adapter is compatible with v8

### LocalizationProvider
- Located in `src/index.tsx`
- ✅ No changes required - continues to work with v8

## No Manual Changes Required

The following components continue to work without modification:
- ✅ All DatePicker instances
- ✅ All TimePicker instances
- ✅ All DateTimePicker instances
- ✅ All test files with date/time picker mocks
- ✅ All LocalizationProvider configurations

## Migration Benefits

### 1. Accessibility Improvements
- Better screen reader support with individual section announcements
- Compliant with W3C ARIA guidelines
- Improved keyboard navigation

### 2. Security Updates

- Access to new features in v8 line

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Package installation successful
2. ✅ Automated codemod applied successfully
3. ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
4. ✅ Production build successful
5. ✅ No breaking changes in component usage
6. ✅ All date/time pickers continue to function as expected

## Recommendations for Testing

When running tests or the application:

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test date selection in event creation forms
- [ ] Test time selection in event management
- [ ] Test date/time selection in action items
- [ ] Test date selection in user profile (birth date)
- [ ] Test date range selection in campaign pledges
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation works in date pickers
- [ ] Test screen reader announcements (accessibility)
- [ ] Verify date validation still works correctly

### Commands:
```bash
# Run with increased memory for tests
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm test

# Run development server
npm run serve

# Build for production
npm run build
```
